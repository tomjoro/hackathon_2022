# hackathon_2022

What is our mini-hackathon?

With production launch we haven't had a lot of time to prepare. 

So treat this with an open-mind and give us feedback so we can do this better next time.

Look at it this way: Because we didn't have a lot of time it means you can be more creative.

Let's have fun and write some code and learn together.

## Time and Audience

9:00 - 14:00 (5 hours) and one hour for lunch. for that's 4. 
 * 3 hours coding
 * 1 hour playing.

 Prerequisites: 
   * Elixir and preferably a Mac. 
   * Github account.

## Plan

We are going to develop something together and then play it.

* Code will be committed to github.

Some coders are very experienced and some are new. We'll focus on Elixir this time. 

It's not a lot of time, so either we setup a framework first (or specifications) or we'll have to limit what we do.

Teams need to be composed of both beginning and advanced codes so we have a good mix.

We don't have a lot of time. But if some want a tutorial instead of jumping right in we can do that too.

We are going to divide into teams of 3-4 people. Each team should have some experienced developers and some not so experienced.
Some parts will be a bit easier. 

Teams will be assessed by:
* Creativity 
* Ability to create a spec
* Ability to work with other teams
* How much they learned 

:)

## Goal

Learn some Elixir and have some fun together by doing something different than typical work.
Play.
Eat some Pizza.

## Project

In this project we will learn:

* Processes and Process Groups
* State management and immutability
* External messaging
* Phoenix and LiveView

The project will be divided into versions. If we achieve the first version we can move to the
second and so on.
